# Introduction
Image inpainting and completion are classical problems in computer vision and graphics.
The objective is to fill semantic and reasonable contents to the corruptions (missing regions)
in an image. Humans can fill the missing regions by the empirical knowledge to the diverse
object structures from the real world. Nevertheless, it is not easy for machines to learn a
wide variety of structures in natural images and predict what to fill in unknown missing-data
regions in images. Thus, it is crucial to know how to learn an image transformation from a
corrupted image with missing data to a completed image.

# Object Removal using cGANs
This project tries to achieve object removal from images and get the base image reconstructed based on surrounding pixels(objects and colours) using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks(cGANs).
